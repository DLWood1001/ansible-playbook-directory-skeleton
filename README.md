Ansible Playbook Project Skeleton
=================================
The purpose of this project is to create a general layout structure for local playbook development. The design is based on [Ansible's Alternative Directory Layout](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#alternative-directory-layout), with some minimal additions.

Notes
=====

Usage
=====
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:DLWood1001/ansible-playbook-project-skeleton.git ansible-playbook-project-project
rm -rf ./ansible-playbook-skeleton-project/.git

Plan
====
1. Re-architect branch stategy
    1. Create branch for base, common folders
    2. Create branch for Ansible's "Directory Layout
    3. Create branch for Ansible's "Alternative Directory Layout
    4. Create branch for my "Expanded Alternative Directory Layout", which is basically what the repo represents currently.
2. Document easier way to clone and setup this project?
